# Surfs Up Weather Analysis
## Overview
Surfs up is a new business W.Avy is looking to start up. It will be a combination surf and ice cream shop. W.Avy asked to perform some analysis on historical weather data to see if the shop will be viable year long. The analysis will compare June and December temperature data to give an estimate of weather conditions in opposite times of the year. 

## Results
Below are tables showing the summary of the data for the two months

Table 1: June Statistics

Table 2: December Statistics

From the two tables we can see many how the temperature compares between the two months, the major differences are:
 -  The mean in December is almost 4 degrees colder
 -  The min in December is 5 degrees colder
 -  The max in December is 2 degrees colder

## Summary
From the temperature data I believe that Surfs Up will be viable to stay open and serve ice cream and provide surfers with quality good year long. 

Looking at temperature data is not enough though. Additional queries I would consider is to look at precipitation data and more months. We need to determine if there is a rainy season in Hawaii because people tend to go out less in the rain and that could have a major impact on business. Along with looking at precipitation data I would also recommend creating more queries to analyze one fall and one spring month.
